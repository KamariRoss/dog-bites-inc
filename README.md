It all starts with HTML
During this week, you will be building a website for your new chain of restaurants. This will have a few pages and will serve us as a playground to learn about web development.

All web pages have to start somewhere, and this site is no different. To start off, you will be laying the groundwork for the days to come.

To start, you will need to start with the HTML and content.

Here is a sample

Requirements
Name your restaurant and decide what type of food you will be selling. This is just a starting point, do not get too hung on this.
Create the Content for your page
Craft semantic HTML for your landing page.
Explorer Mode
Read through these notes
Decided on the details for your restaurant. This should include, but not limited to :
Name
Type of Cuisine
Location(s)
Upcoming events
3 featured dishes
Create the semantic HTML for the all the details above
Add at least 3 images
Create at least 3 links on the page
Your website should minimally have
a navbar
a "hero" section
at least 3 sections about the restaurant, get creative here. Specials, events and locations would be a good start here.
